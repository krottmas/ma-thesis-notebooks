# Jupyter Notebooks for thesis research 

This repository contains the two jupyter notebooks created in course of my thesis's research in an abstracted version (e.g. more general variable and function names, dummy text for URLs, exemplified to show the necessary steps, etc.). <br/>
The notebook **"Steam-Reviewextraction"** is need to extract the reviews from steam and save them to local storage to not exhaust the API limits and also to work on the data offline. <br>
The notebook **"Reviewdata-preprocessing"** sorts the reviews according to language and creation/update date; creates various tables (overviewtables als well as reviewtables if necessary) and extracts the reviews into TXT-files per year. The TXT-files can be used to explore the texts further.
